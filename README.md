# Climate_Change_LLM_Project
In this project, the proposal will provide a complete end-to-end system adapting a pretrained Large Language Model to a domain-specific question answering task based on climate change. Fine-tuning a pretrained GPT-2 model with a curated question -answer dataset allows the model to produce contextually relevant and domain-aware responses.
