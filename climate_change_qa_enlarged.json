    },
    {
        "question": "What are the risks of sea level rise?",
        "answer": "Sea level rise threatens coastal communities with flooding, erosion, and damage to infrastructure, as well as the displacement of millions of people due to the loss of land."
    },
    {
        "question": "How does energy efficiency help reduce climate change?",
        "answer": "Energy efficiency reduces the amount of energy needed for various tasks, thereby lowering greenhouse gas emissions associated with energy production, and helps conserve natural resources."
    },
    {
        "question": "What is the effect of climate change on human migration?",
        "answer": "Climate change can drive human migration by displacing populations due to extreme weather, rising sea levels, and resource scarcity, creating climate refugees."
    },
    {
        "question": "How does carbon dioxide contribute to the greenhouse effect?",
        "answer": "Carbon dioxide is a major greenhouse gas that traps heat in the atmosphere, causing the Earth's surface temperature to rise and contributing to global warming."
    },
    {
        "question": "What is the impact of global warming on polar ice caps?",
        "answer": "Global warming causes the melting of polar ice caps, contributing to rising sea levels and disrupting ecosystems dependent on ice-covered regions."
    },
    {
        "question": "What is the importance of carbon pricing in combating climate change?",
        "answer": "Carbon pricing, such as through carbon taxes or cap-and-trade systems, encourages businesses to reduce emissions by making it financially advantageous to adopt cleaner technologies."
    },
    {
        "question": "What are the benefits of plant-based diets in addressing climate change?",
